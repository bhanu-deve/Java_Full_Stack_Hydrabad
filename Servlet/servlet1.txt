Web application 
===============
A web application is a collection of web resource programs having capability to generate web pages. 

We have two types of web pages.

1) Static web pages / Passive web pages
----------------------------------
	Static web pages show fixed content.
	ex:
		Home page 
		Aboutus page 
		facebook login page 
		email login page 
		and etc.

2) Dynamic web pages / Active web pages  
--------------------------------------
	Dynamic web pages show dynamic content.
	ex:
		cricket live score page 
		stock market share value page 
		gmail inbox page 
		and etc.

We have two types of web resource programs.

1) Static web resource programs 
------------------------------
	Static web resource programs are used to generate static web pages.
	ex:
		HTML program 
		CSS program 
		Bootstrap program 
		angularjs program
		and etc.

2) Dynamic web resource programs 
---------------------------------
	Dynamic web resource programs are used to develop dynamic web pages.
	ex:
		servlet program 
		jsp program 
		and etc.

Based on the position and execution these web resource programs categories into two types.

1) Client side web resource program 
---------------------------------
A web resource program which execute at client side (browser window) is called client side web resource program.

All static web resource programs are called client side web resource program.

ex:
	HTML program 
	CSS program 
	Bootstrap program 
	angularjs program 
	and etc.


2) Server side web resource program 
-------------------------------------
A web resource program which execute at server side is called server side web resource program.

All dynamic web resource programs are called server side web resource programs.

ex:
	servlet program 
	jsp program 
	and etc.


Web Application and Web Resource Program execution 
===================================================
Java application will execute manually.

Web application and web resource program will execute at the time when they have requested. Hence there is no chance of executing them manually.

Diagram: servlet1.1

With respect to the diagram:

1) Enduser gives the request to web resource program.

2) Web server traps that request and passes that request to appropriate web resource 
   program. 

3) Web resource program executes the logic to process the request.

4) Web resource program communicates with database software if necessary.

5) Web resource program gives output to web server.

6) Web server sends result to browser window as dynamic web page.

Note:
----
	The process of keeping the web application in a server is called deployment
	and reverse is called undeployment.

Web Server 
==========
A web server is a piece of software which is used to automate whole process of web application and web resource program execution.
ex:
	Tomcat, Resin and etc.

Responsibilities of web server 
------------------------------
1) It takes continues request from client.

2) It passes that request to appropriate web resource program.

3) It provides environment to deploy and undeploy the web application.

4) It will add middleware services only to deployed web applications.

5) It allows client side web resource program to execute at browse window.

6) It gathers the result from web resource program.

7) It sends the output to browser window as dynamic response.

8) It automates whole process of web application and web resource program execution.

ex:
	To execute java program we required JRE/JVM.
	To execute servlet program we required servlet container.
	To execute jsp program we required jsp container.


Web Container
==============
It is a software application or a program that is used to manage whole life cycle of web resource programs i.e birth to death.

Some part of industry considers servlet container and JSP container are web containers.

Every server is designed to support servlet container and JSP container.

Servlet container executes servlet program.

Similarly, JSP container executes JSP program.

Tomcat Software Installation
============================
Double click to Tomcat software --> yes --> Next --> I Agree --> Select (Full) -->
Next --> adminstrator login --> 
username : admin  
password: admin --> Next --> Next --> Install.


Steps to set Tomcat server to manual mode 
===========================================
Goto services --> Select Apache Tomcat --> click to stop link --> double click to 
Apache Tomcat --> startup type : manual --> apply --> ok.



How to change the port number of Tomcat server
=============================================
Goto Tomcat9.0 --> config ---> server.xml --> 

<Connector port="2525" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
               connectionTimeout="20000"
               redirectPort="8443"
               maxParameterCount="1000"
               />


How to see Tomcat console page
===============================
1) First start Tomcat server from bin folder.
    
2) Type below request url in browser address bar.
   ex:
	http://localhost:2525
